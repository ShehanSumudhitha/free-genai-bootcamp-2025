## Examples
Here are the examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>

<user:input>
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>
<score>4</score>
<score_reasons>
- BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
- BAD: the Beginner sentence is uncessary, should just showing the vocabulary table
- BAD: In the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the students needs to figure that out.
- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this:
[Location]  [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
</score_reasons>
<assistant:output>
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:
|Japanese |Romaji |English
          |kuma   |bear
          |tobira |door
          |gomi   |garbage
          |noko   |leave behind

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".
For the first clause, we can use the verb(aru) which means "to exist" or "to be present".
We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
For the second clause, we can use the verb (nokosu) which is a more polite way of saying "to leave behind". Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.

Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Clause 1: Bears are at the door]
[Subject] wa [Location] ni [Verb] desu
[Clause 2: did you leave the garbage out?]
[Verb] masu ka
Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence provided?
