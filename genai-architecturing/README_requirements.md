## Business Requirements
A Japanese learning institution aims to develop a proprietary product leveraging generative AI to enhance learning efficiency for both tutors and students. This initiative is driven by the desire to create a cost-effective solution that improves the educational experience while maintaining control over the technology.

## Functional Requirements
The product should incorporate a Japanese sentence constructor based on the provided diagram. It should allow users to build grammatically correct sentences by selecting appropriate elements such as topic, subject, object, verb, and modifiers. The system should guide users through the sentence construction process, offering suggestions and explanations for each component to facilitate language learning.

## Non-Functional Requirements
The system must be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that caters to both Japanese language learners and native speakers. It should provide real-time feedback on sentence construction, ensuring high performance and responsiveness. The product should also support multiple users simultaneously, maintaining data privacy and security for all users.

## Tooling
To develop this product, the institution should consider using a modern web development framework such as React or Vue.js for the frontend, coupled with a robust backend like Node.js or Django. For the AI component, TensorFlow or PyTorch could be utilized to implement natural language processing models. Version control should be managed through Git, with continuous integration and deployment pipelines set up using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.

## Data Strategy
The system should collect and analyze user interactions to improve its sentence construction suggestions over time. A comprehensive database of Japanese vocabulary, grammar rules, and usage examples should be developed and regularly updated. User data must be anonymized and securely stored in compliance with Japanese data protection regulations.

## Scalability
The product should be designed with a microservices architecture to allow for easy scaling of individual components. Cloud services like AWS or Azure can be utilized to ensure the system can handle increasing user loads. Implement caching mechanisms and load balancing to optimize performance during peak usage periods.

## Constraints

The product must adhere to Japanese educational standards and cultural sensitivities. It should be accessible on various devices, including smartphones and tablets, which may limit some design choices. The development team must work within the institution's budget and timeline constraints while ensuring the product meets all required functionalities.

## Considerations
Investment suggestions include robust cloud infrastructure to ensure high availability and performance, comprehensive security measures to protect user data and intellectual property, and a dedicated data science team to continuously improve the AI model. Estimated costs may range from $5,000 to $10,000 for initial development and first-year operations, including infrastructure, licensing, and personnel. This investment is justified by the potential for long-term cost savings in tutoring resources and the creation of a valuable, scalable educational asset.
